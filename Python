#Problem Solving 1

#1.Program to display a person's name , age and address in three lines
name =  "Harsha"
age = 24
address = "123 Main St."
print("Name:",name)
print("Age:",age)
print("Address:",address)
#Output:
# Name: Harsha
# Age: 24
# Address: 123 Main St.

#2.Swap values of two variables
#Method 1
a = 10
b = 20
print("Before swaping:",a)
print("Before swaping:",b)
temp = a
a = b
b = temp
print("After swaping:",a)
print("After swaping:",b)
#Output:
# Before swaping: 10
# Before swaping: 20
# After swaping: 20
# After swaping: 10

#Method 2
a = 10
b = 20
print("Before swaping:",a)
print("Before swaping:",b)
a,b = b,a
print("After swaping:",a)
print("After swaping:",b)
#Output:
# Before swaping: 10
# Before swaping: 20
# After swaping: 20
# After swaping: 10

#3.Convert float number into integer number
number1 = float(input("Enter a number: "))
print(type(number1))
number2 = int(number1)
print(type(number2))
print(number2)
#Output:
# Enter a number: 13.2
# <class 'float'>
# <class 'int'>
# 13

#4.Student ID-card
school = input("Enter the school name: ")
name = input("Enter your name: ")
grade = input("Enter your grade: ")
dateofbirth = input("Enter your date of birth: ")
phone = input("Enter your phone number: ")
email = input("Enter your email: ")
print(school)
print("Name of the Student:",name)
print("Grade:",grade)
print("Date of Birth:",dateofbirth)
print("Phone Number:",phone)
print("Email:",email)
#Output:
# Loyola Model High School
# Name of the Student: Patnaik Sai Harsha Vardhan
# Grade: 10th A
# Date of Birth: 13th , July , 2001
# Phone Number: +91-9390614019
# Email: harshapatnaik789@gmail.com

#5.Program to take an user input as an Integer and then covert it to float
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(type(age))
age = float(input("Enter your age: "))
print(age)
print(type(age))
#Output:
# Enter your age: 24
# <class 'int'>
# Enter your age: 24
# 24.0
# <class 'float'>

#Problem Solving 2

## Hi ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š !  all my name is Harsha Patnaik , this my learning journey of Data Analytics .My Learning Approch : "Solving Problem Statements related to Data Analytics Path" 

# Data-Analytics

Data analytics is the process of examining raw data to uncover patterns, derive insights, and make informed decisions, ultimately converting data into actionable business intelligence.

# Roadmap for Data Analytics:

# Python Programming Language:

â®ž Python Programming Language is both compiled and interpreted , object oriented high-level programming language with dynamic sematics.

â®ž Python Programming Language was developed by "Guido Van Rossum".

## Features of Python Programming Language:

â®ž Object Oriented 

â®ž Dynamically typed 

â®ž GUI programming support

â®ž Extensible

â®ž Large Standard Library

â®ž Free and open source

â®ž Cross Platform Language

â®ž Interpreted language

â®ž Expressive language 

â®ž Easy to learn & use 

## Applications of Python Programming Language:

â®ž Data Science

â®ž Web Development

â®ž Data Engineering

â®ž Machine Learning 

â®ž Artificial Intelligence 

â®ž Data Analytics  and so on...etc 

## Note: I used Python 3.13.7 & PyCharm.

## Variables:

Variables are place holders, which can store a value.

### Ex: 

Input: a = "Hello World"

           print(a)

Output: Hello World

## Rules of Variables

â®ž Case sensitive 

â®ž No spacing

â®ž Should not start with special characters (# , @ , | ...etc)

## Data Types 

â®ž Text type : String(str)

â®ž Numeric types : Integer(int) , floating poing(float) , Complex

â®ž Sequence types : list , tuple and range 

â®ž Mapping type : Dictionaries(dict)

â®ž Set type : set , frozenset

â®ž Boolean type : bool

â®ž Binary types : bytes , bytearray , memoryview  

## User - Input

### Syntax : 
    Ex : name = input("enter your name:")

### Note : Evaluete â†’ eval


###
     Ex : expl = eval(input("enter any equation here : ")) 

## Type Casting 

Conversion of one data type to another is called as type casting 

They are of two types : Implicit typecasting  , Explicit typecasting 

### Note : "type" is a data type it tells about the type of the data 

    Ex: Input : name = "Harsha"
                print(type(name))
        Output : <class 'str'>
        
## Implicit typecasting : Automatically converting 

## Explicit typecasting : 

    Ex: Input: a = "123"
               a = float(a)
               print(a)
        Output: 123.0
